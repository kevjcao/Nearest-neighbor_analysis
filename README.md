# Nearest-neighbor_analysis
This code takes ROIs of cells from Ca2+ movies, selected using ImageJ/FIJI, to:
1. Calculate the average radius of selected cells from each movie
2. Caclulate the average distance between the nearest neighbor of cells
3. Shuffles the spacing between selected cells and recalculates the average distance between nearest neighbors
